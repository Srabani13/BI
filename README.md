# ETL Project: Interactive Dashboard Using Demo Data

# Project Overview
This project involves the creation of an interactive dashboard using demo data. The primary goals are to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from various sources into a format suitable for analysis and visualization. The interactive dashboard provides insights and key metrics that help in data-driven decision-making.
